% Country/ies j imposes sanctions on country/ies i, sector(s) r.
% upstreamBan extract the (SHOT) upstream impact of sanctions (global

% Inputs:
%       Z     Double      intermediate input-output matrix (NRxNR) 
%       F     Double      Final demand (NRxN) matrix
%       emb_i Double      sanctioned country/ies
%       emb_r Double      sanctioned industry/ies

% Output:
